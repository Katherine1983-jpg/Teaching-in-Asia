            <li><em> VISAs </em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you are satisfied that your new employer will offer a good
            salary, after living costs, and that they will offer a good standard
            of education for your children, it’s time to get organised. The
            school’s admin team should send you information about the VISA
            process and more recently, vaccine and quarantine requirements.
            Every International School I’ve worked with has been good at this
            but I’d still recommend asking questions if you’re unsure about
            something. Depending on the country, the VISA process might require
            multiple trips to the embassy. If you live a long way from the
            embassy, this can be a real problem. There are companies, who will,
            for a fee, sort this out for you. I’ve only used a VISA company
            once, but they were very efficient and took the majority of the
            hassle out of getting five of us to China. If you accepted an offer
            late in the academic year and there’s not much time before you leave
            (perhaps three or four months), this might be a good option for you.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em> Apps </em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you’ve been ‘buddied up’ with a teacher at your new school before
            you go, ask them about Apps they recommend. Depending on where
            you’re going, there will be apps that everyone uses for
            communication, transport, banking, food delivery, and making
            payments and you’ll be using most of them the first day you arrive!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><em> Shipping </em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The first two occasions that I travelled with my family, we did so
            with just a suitcase and carry on. This is very achievable and I the
            option I prefer. Shipping can be costly in terms of time and money
            and is generally worth avoiding if possible. Having said that, I
            have used a shipping companies for things like bicycles, my
            children’s books, sentimental things and a few small pieces of
            furniture. If you want to ship, get quotes from as many different
            companies as possible as their prices can really vary. As the items
            I shipped were inconvenient to replace rather than valuable, I opted
            out of the insurance which saved me about 20% of what the cost would
            have been.
