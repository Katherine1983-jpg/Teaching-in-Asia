            The pace of the changes in your life can be astonishing once you
            arrive in your new country. Typically, your employer might put you
            in contact with a local letting agent who will arrange for you see
            to a number of properties within a set budget. You are likely to be
            able to have picked the best of the bunch and moved in within about
            a week of landing. Before you sign though, see whether you can
            haggle a little with the price – it doesn’t hurt to try and also ask
            for any snag jobs to be fixed before you move in, e.g. replacing
            some worn fixtures or touching up the paint. I’ve found that my
            landlords are usually very happy to accommodate (pun intended)! The
            time between moving from a hotel to your new house or apartment
            might be so fast that you won’t have had time to buy sheets for the
            beds! This has happened to my family several times. We now pack a
            few old sheets and thin blankets just in case! Once in your new
            place, try doing a few dry runs of your commute. How long does it
            take to order a ride share, hail a cab, walk, cycle, scoot or drive
            to work? Get yourself sorted out with online grocery deliveries and
            a take-out service to make life easier and enjoy exploring your
            local area. If you’re looking for childcare, now’s the time to get
            in touch with people. I’ve been fortunate to employ people
            recommended by colleagues. Many childcare workers also know others
            in the same business so if a family at your school employs someone,
            ask them if they have contacts.
