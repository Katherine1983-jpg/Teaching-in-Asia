          <p>
            Problems you have with your employer when working abroad can be
            extremely stressful. Often it can seem as if school owners and the
            leaders they’ve employed to run their ship hold all the cards and
            that there’s little to no recourse for disputes. Should you find
            yourself in a situation where you have a problem with the school’s
            direction (or lack thereof) or a grievance with staff members,
            you’ll have to think carefully about the best course of action for
            you. I believe this needs stating as many dedicated teachers put the
            needs of their students first at all times despite the personal cost
            to themselves. Of course, everybody has their own boundaries when it
            comes to their relationship with an employer, however here’s my top
            seven list of poor behaviours from some of the International Schools
            I’ve worked:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>
                Unqualified and/or poorly performing staff teaching dependents
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>
                Non-payment, or a change of medical insurance without consulting
                staff
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><em> Removal of end of contract flight allowance </em></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>
                Reducing the level of medical insurance without consultation
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><em> Reduction in pay </em></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>
                Swapping E-Learning periods for summer holidays without
                consultation, resulting in being unable to visit family
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em> Regular late payment of salary (by up to 14 days) </em>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            No doubt this series of unfortunate events was confounded by
            Covid-19, but by no means were all of these problems experienced
            from wholly during this period and I’ve found that many colleagues
            in other establishments had experienced similar during their
            careers. The only recourse I felt I had when my contract was broken
            was to leave at a time that suited me rather than one that suited my
            employer. I remained very dedicated and professional and made an
            effort to be really cheerful toward my colleagues (after all my life
            would be easier if I could go with a good reference). Sometimes I
            had to wait longer than I wanted in order to ensure I received an
            end of contract bonus and other times I left my school with very
            little notice. You just need to weigh up what the best outcome for
            you will be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please don’t let my experiences frighten you though. I’ve found
            working abroad really rewarding both professionally and financially
            and I certainly don’t regret it at all!
