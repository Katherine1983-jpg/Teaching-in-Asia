          <h2 class="section-headings" id="questions">Questions to ask</h2>
          <p>
            To be honest, there’s a laundry list of worthwhile questions to ask
            your potential employer before you travel abroad. My top three
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Will you provide medical insurance for my dependents?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Schools really vary on this. In China, medical insurance which
            covers care at private hospitals, can be very costly, so some
            employers won’t cover insurance costs for kids. Annual insurance for
            each of my children cost around 60% of a month’s salary. The school
            paid the insurer up front and reclaimed the cost over a three-month
            period from my salary. The cost of comparable medical insurance in
            other areas of Asia can vary dramatically. When I worked in
            Thailand, the costs were relatively low so my contract also included
            full medical cover for my kids.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em
                >What does housing for a family of x people typically cost?</em
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In my experience, the majority of expatriate teachers travel
            individually or as couples. Where companies offer accommodation
            payments as part of the contract, they may consider the price of a
            one bed apartment as the base point for their offer. When travelling
            as a teaching couple, some schools double the allowance, others just
            add a small percentage. There may well be a gulf between the cost of
            renting a one-bedroom apartment and housing that will fit a family
            so make enquiries before you go. I recommend asking your employer
            and looking at the websites of some letting agents in order to help
            you get your budget in order.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em
                >How is English, Maths, Science etc. taught in your school?</em
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When visiting the websites of International Schools, many state that
            they follow the British National Curriculum, International Primary
            Curriculum, Cambridge Curriculum, Read, Write Inc, Whiterose, Rising
            Stars etc. If you have dependents that will attend the schools, I
            recommend doing a lot of digging! Some programs are very
            proscriptive and in depth, with precise objectives, lesson plans and
            resources. Others are less prescriptive, allowing good teachers to
            be more creative, and less skilled practitioners to make it up as
            they go along. If the people on your interview panel cannot talk
            knowledgably about their curriculum, that may be a cause for
            concern.
