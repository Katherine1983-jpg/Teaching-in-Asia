          <p>
            As we had decided to move to Shanghai for our first post, we did
            need to consider our accommodation costs very carefully. In
            Shanghai, Beijing and Hong-Kong, accommodation costs are very high;
            especially if you want to live in something bigger than a shoebox.
            Most international schools offer a housing allowance, but usually
            they are not enough to cover a place for a family. The accommodation
            allowance our school offered would cover a tiny, one bed apartment.
            As a family, we were paying around 1300GBP per month for a three bed
            apartment, after our allowance was deducted. What’s more, the
            landlords often require a deposit of two months’ rent and the 1st
            rent payment up front. We needed a bank loan before we even stepped
            off the plane and started earning! In Bangkok, accommodation costs
            were much more manageable and comparable to most areas of the U.K.
            (outside of London.) There were also a range of accommodation types:
            from apartments to large detached houses, within budget. For 1000GBP
            per month, we were able to rent a three-bedroom house with a large
            garden and a swimming pool on the outskirts of the city.
