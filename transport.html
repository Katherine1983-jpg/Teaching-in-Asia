            Another factor to consider when choosing where to apply is how easy
            it will be to get around. In China for example, it is prohibitively
            difficult for many foreigners to get a driving license. In fact,
            none of the teachers I’ve ever worked with in China drove. However,
            the ride hailing services such as 'Didi' were reliable and
            affordable. Even when getting around with the whole family, there
            was an option to book bigger vehicles so having no car was actually
            quite liberating. For shorter trips, you can easily purchase and
            obtain a license for an electric scooter. At roughly 300GBP, you can
            get yourself a new one to whizz around the city at 30MPH…but do wear
            a helmet! In Thailand, we found it much easier to rent a car. As we
            lived on the outskirts of the city, this was convenient as ride
            hailing apps operated patchy service. The car was relatively
            expensive however, at around 440GBP per month, including insurance.
