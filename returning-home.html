          <p>
            Deciding to return home can bring up a plethora of mixed emotions.
            Some of the very best teachers I’ve met while abroad were really
            looking forward to returning to the rigor and professionalism that
            is characteristic of state schools in their home countries but were
            worried about the nosedive their personal finances would take. As
            I’d set out a strict saving plan, I was happy that I’d paid off
            money I’d borrowed for my wedding and had no remaining credit card
            debt…for the first time since I was 18! My husband had managed to
            clear his credit cards and even managed to pay off his student loan.
            As debt was a big cause of stress for my family, we felt, despite
            having limited savings, we were in a much better position to enjoy
            life in the U.K. My three children were also keen to go home – we’d
            promised them we’d settle in one place until they were done with
            school! They’ve experienced different cultures, lived in some
            fantastic places and enjoyed holidays we could have never afforded
            if we’d had stayed at home. Once they’re grown, I may be tempted to
            try the international game once again.
