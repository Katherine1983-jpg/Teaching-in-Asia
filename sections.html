            My husband and I decided to take the first holiday we’d had in
            years. We couldn’t afford to, but we needed time to consider our
            future and at home the routine we’d found ourselves in didn’t allow
            for clear, level–headed thinking. We were both working in full-time
            teaching jobs, in managerial posts which required a lot of our time
            and drained our emotions. Taking a break from the usual routine was
            a good idea and allowed us to evaluate our situation. It was really
            only on this trip to a snowy cabin in Wales that we realised were we
            ready for an adventure abroad. If you are unsure about whether
            teaching in a different country is the right path for you, taking
            some time to clear your head can be a great start.

          <p>
            When I decided to apply, the push factors were likely be familiar to
            many teachers, especially those with a young family: feeling totally
            exhausted at the end of another week teaching in a school with a
            class of 30+ students. With having three young children at home,
            money was tight. Nights out were few and far between. When the
            weekend did come round, work pervaded - our minds would wander,
            thinking about the combative meeting just around the corner with an
            angry parent or overbearing pedant on the leadership team. The
            soothing light at the end of the tunnel is just a freight train
            coming your way; don’t worry, when you’re 68 and the kids of the
            kids you teach have had kids, you might finally get to draw your
            pension. But, at the moment, you’re just a little more in debt every
            month and feeling as if something might snap. The long-term effects
            of these factors can take their toll.

            When I began my search, the jobs advertised for a classroom teacher
            position on the TES site, with no additional management
            responsibilities, would give me a net salary of around 30% more than
            my take-home, as an Upper Pay Scale teacher in England. On top of
            this, were end of salary bonuses worth around 4000GBP per year and
            accommodation allowances too. We would even be able to afford to
            come home and visit family each summer, as many jobs were providing
            an annual flight allowance for the employees. These perks were
            fairly typical of the jobs offered in schools in China, Malaysia,
            Thailand, etc. Some schools even offer to pauy for medical insurance
            and offer a 500GBP payment at the start of contract to buy homeware
            items. As my husband is also a teacher, we could double most of
            these benefits.

            It was clear that the schools offering the most competitive salaries
            and packages were where the most wealthy parents were likely to be
            located – the mega-cities. Sure, you can go and teach 15 minutes
            from the beach on a paradise island, but the salaries on offer are
            around half of what you’ll receive in major population hubs. As
            money was one of the major pull factors, we decided to apply for
            city jobs.

            During the initial application stage, it can be hard to gauge all of
            the expectations employers will have of your time. International
            Schools tend to have earlier start times and later finishing times
            than schools in England. There’s also the need to consider what
            you’ll do with your little ones during Parents' Evenings and late
            meetings, etc. as hanging around in mum or dad’s class might not be
            a desirable option for the school or for your offspring. When I
            worked in China, colleagues already in post helped me to find
            childcare in the form of an 'Ayi'. She was a dream – multilingual,
            kind, patient, an amazing cook...the list was endless. Her monthly
            rate cost me around one third of my salary and she was paid double
            February’s salary as it was Chinese New Year! There are countless
            agencies that can help you find help once you arrive. Things can be
            arranged quickly and so organising prior to arrival is usually
            unnessary and you are likely to want a trial before you commit to
            anything contractual. An expense, yes, but we really couldn't have
            survived those first two years without her.

            As we had decided to move to Shanghai for our first post, we did
            need to consider our accommodation costs very carefully. In
            Shanghai, Beijing and Hong-Kong, accommodation costs are very high;
            especially if you want to live in something bigger than a shoebox.
            Most international schools offer a housing allowance, but usually
            they are not enough to cover a place for a family. The accommodation
            allowance our school offered would cover a tiny, one bed apartment.
            As a family, we were paying around 1300GBP per month for a three bed
            apartment, after our allowance was deducted. What’s more, the
            landlords often require a deposit of two months’ rent and the 1st
            rent payment up front. We needed a bank loan before we even stepped
            off the plane and started earning! In Bangkok, accommodation costs
            were much more manageable and comparable to most areas of the U.K.
            (outside of London.) There were also a range of accommodation types:
            from apartments to large detached houses, within budget. For 1000GBP
            per month, we were able to rent a three-bedroom house with a large
            garden and a swimming pool on the outskirts of the city.

            Another factor to consider when choosing where to apply is how easy
            it will be to get around. In China for example, it is prohibitively
            difficult for many foreigners to get a driving license. In fact,
            none of the teachers I’ve ever worked with in China drove. However,
            the ride hailing services such as 'Didi' were reliable and
            affordable. Even when getting around with the whole family, there
            was an option to book bigger vehicles so having no car was actually
            quite liberating. For shorter trips, you can easily purchase and
            obtain a license for an electric scooter. At roughly 300GBP, you can
            get yourself a new one to whizz around the city at 30MPH…but do wear
            a helmet! In Thailand, we found it much easier to rent a car. As we
            lived on the outskirts of the city, this was convenient as ride
            hailing apps operated patchy service. The car was relatively
            expensive however, at around 440GBP per month, including insurance.

          </ul>
          <p>
            If you are satisfied that your new employer will offer a good
            salary, after living costs, and that they will offer a good standard
            of education to your children, it’s time to get organised. The
            school’s admin team should send you information about the VISA
            process and more recently, vaccine and quarantine requirements.
            Every International School I’ve worked with has been good at this
            but I’d still recommend asking questions if you’re unsure about
            something. Depending on the country, the VISA process might require
            multiple trips to the embassy. If you live a long way from the
            embassy, this can be a real problem. There are companies, who will,
            for a fee, sort this out for you. I’ve only used a VISA company
            once, but they were very efficient and took the majority of the
            hassle out of getting five of us to China. If you accepted an offer
            late in the academic year and there’s not much time before you leave
            (perhaps three or four months), this might be a good option for you.

            <li><em> Apps </em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you’ve been ‘buddied up’ with a teacher at your new school before
            you go, ask them about Apps they recommend. Depending on where
            you’re going, there will be apps that everyone uses for
            communication, transport, banking, food delivery, and making
            payments and you’ll be using most of them the first day you arrive!

            The first two occasions that I travelled with my family, we did so
            with just a suitcase and carry on. This is very achievable and I the
            option I prefer. Shipping can be costly in terms of time and money
            and is generally worth avoiding if possible. Having said that, I
            have used a shipping company once for things like bicycles, my
            children’s books, sentimental things and a few small pieces of
            furniture. If you want to ship, get quotes from as many different
            companies as possible as their prices can really vary. As the items
            I shipped were inconvenient to replace rather than valuable, I opted
            out of the insurance which saved me about 20% of what the cost would
            have been.

            The pace of the changes in your life can be astonishing once you
            arrive in your new country. Typically, your employer might put you
            in contact with a local letting agent who will arrange for you see
            to a number of properties within a set budget. You are likely to be
            able to have picked the best of the bunch and moved in within about
            a week of landing. Before you sign though, see whether you can
            haggle a little with the price – it doesn’t hurt to try and also ask
            for any snag jobs to be fixed before you move in, e.g. replacing
            some worn fixtures or touching up the paint. I’ve found that my
            landlords are usually very happy to accommodate (pun intended)! The
            time between moving from a hotel to your new house or apartment
            might be so fast that you won’t have had time to buy sheets for the
            beds! This has happened to my family several times. We now pack a
            few old sheets and thin blankets just in case! Once in your new
            place, try doing a few dry runs of your commute. How long does it
            take to order a ride share, hail a cab, walk, cycle, scoot or drive
            to work? Get yourself sorted out with online grocery deliveries and
            a take-out service to make life easier and enjoy exploring your
            local area. If you’re looking for childcare, now’s the time to get
            in touch with people. I’ve been fortunate to employ people
            recommended by colleagues. Many childcare workers also know others
            in the same business so if a family at your school employs someone,
            ask them if they have contacts.

            Problems you have with your employer when working abroad can be
            extremely stressful. Often it can seem as if school owners and the
            leaders they’ve employed to run their ship hold all the cards and
            that there’s little to no recourse for disputes. Should you find
            yourself in a situation where you have a problem with the school’s
            direction (or lack thereof) or a grievance with staff members,
            you’ll have to think carefully about the best course of action for
            you. I believe this needs stating as many dedicated teachers put the
            needs of their students first at all times despite the personal cost
            to themselves. Of course, everybody has their own boundaries when it
            comes to their relationship with an employer, however here’s my top
            seven list of poor behaviours from some of the International Schools
            I’ve worked:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>
                Unqualified and/or poorly performing staff teaching dependents
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>
                Non-payment, or a change of medical insurance without consulting
                staff
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><em> Removal of end of contract flight allowance </em></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>
                Reducing the level of medical insurance without consultation
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><em> Reduction in pay </em></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>
                Swapping E-Learning periods for summer holidays without
                consultation, resulting in being unable to visit family
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em> Regular late payment of salary (by up to 14 days) </em>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            No doubt this series of unfortunate events was confounded by
            Covid-19, but by no means were all of these problems experienced
            from wholly during this period and I’ve found that many colleagues
            in other establishments had experienced similar during their
            careers. The only recourse I felt I had when my contract was broken
            was to leave at a time that suited me rather than one that suited my
            employer. I remained very dedicated and professional and made an
            effort to be really cheerful toward my colleagues (after all my life
            would be easier if I could go with a good reference). Sometimes I
            had to wait longer than I wanted in order to ensure I received an
            end of contract bonus and other times I left my school with very
            little notice. You just need to weigh up what the best outcome for
            you will be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please don’t let my experiences frighten you though. I’ve found
            working abroad really rewarding both professionally and financially
            and I certainly don’t regret it at all!

          <p>
            Deciding to return home can bring up a plethora of mixed emotions.
            Some of the very best teachers I’ve met while abroad were really
            looking forward to the rigor and professionalism that is
            characteristic of state schools in their home countries but were
            worried about the nosedive their personal finances would take. As
            I’d set out a strict saving plan, I was happy that I’d paid off
            money I’d borrowed for my wedding and had no remaining credit card
            debt…for the first time since I was 18! My husband had managed to
            clear his credit cards and even managed to pay off his student loan.
            As debt was a big cause of stress for my family, we felt, despite
            having limited savings, we were in a much better position to enjoy
            life in the U.K. My three children were also keen to go home – we’d
            promised them we’d settle in one place until they were done with
            school! They’d experienced different cultures, lived in some
            fantastic places and enjoyed holidays we could have never afforded
            if we’d had stayed at home. Once they’re grown, I may be tempted to
            try the international game once again.

          <h2 class="section-headings" id="questions">Questions to ask</h2>
          <p>
            To be honest, there’s a laundry list of worthwhile questions to ask
            your potential employer before you travel abroad. My top three
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Will you provide medical insurance for my dependents?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Schools really vary on this. In China, medical insurance which
            covers care at private hospitals, can be very costly, so some
            employers won’t cover insurance costs for kids. Annual insurance for
            each of my children cost around 60% of a month’s salary. The school
            paid the insurer up front and reclaimed the cost over a three-month
            period from my salary. The cost of comparable medical insurance in
            other areas of Asia can vary dramatically. When I worked in
            Thailand, the costs were relatively low so my contract also included
            full medical cover for my kids.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em
                >What does housing for a family of x people typically cost?</em
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In my experience, the majority of expatriate teachers travel
            individually or as couples. Where companies offer accommodation
            payments as part of the contract, they may consider the price of a
            one bed apartment as the base point for their offer. When travelling
            as a teaching couple, some schools double the allowance, others just
            add a small percentage. There may well be a gulf between the cost of
            renting a one-bedroom apartment and housing that will fit a family
            so make enquiries before you go. I recommend asking your employer
            and looking at the websites of some letting agents in order to help
            you get your budget in order.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em
                >How is English, Maths, Science etc. taught in your school?</em
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When visiting the websites of International Schools, many state that
            they follow the British National Curriculum, International Primary
            Curriculum, Cambridge Curriculum, Read, Write Inc, Whiterose, Rising
            Stars etc. If you have dependents that will attend the schools, I
            recommend doing a lot of digging! Some programs are very
            proscriptive and in depth, with precise objectives, lesson plans and
            resources. Others are less prescriptive, allowing good teachers to
            be more creative, and less skilled practitioners to make it up as
            they go along. If the people on your interview panel cannot talk
            knowledgably about their curriculum, that may be a cause for
            concern.
