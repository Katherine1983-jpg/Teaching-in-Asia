            During the initial application stage, it can be hard to gauge all of
            the expectations employers will have of your time. International
            Schools tend to have earlier start times and later finishing times
            than schools in England. There’s also the need to consider what
            you’ll do with your little ones during Parents' Evenings and late
            meetings, etc. as hanging around in mum or dad’s class might not be
            a desirable option for the school or for your offspring. When I
            worked in China, colleagues already in post helped me to find
            childcare in the form of an 'Ayi'. She was a dream – multilingual,
            kind, patient, an amazing cook...the list was endless. Her monthly
            rate cost me around one third of my salary and she was paid double
            February’s salary as it was Chinese New Year! There are countless
            agencies that can help you find help once you arrive. Things can be
            arranged quickly and so organising prior to arrival is usually
            unnessary and you are likely to want a trial before you commit to
            anything contractual. An expense, yes, but we really couldn't have
            survived those first two years without her.
